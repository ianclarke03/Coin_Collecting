My game is essentially a coin collecting game. You play as a robot collecting 
coins that randomly generate on the screen and attempt to get the highest score
 possible. It is possible to grab more than one coin at once.

Starting from where we left off in the recordings, I added two new files to my 
Game_IC folder, MyGame.h and MyGame.cpp.

To implement the coins, I added a Coin class in MyGame.h and use a GenerateCoin()
 function in my constructor along with collision functions to detect and record 
collisions in MyGame.cpp. Because of the random nature of these functions, it is 
possible to pick up multiple coins at once by only touching one.

The playable character is a robot and you can move it around with the arrow keys. 
I have an OnKeyPress(), OnKeyRelease(), and UpdateRobotPosition() functions to 
control the movement of the robot.

With very collision made, I increment a score count in the top left corner. The 
numbers come from a folder in Assets/Pictures named digits_folder. I took my 
current score as an int, converted it to a string, and for every character in 
that string, converted it back to its corresponding number png image. The solution
 to this was similar to our in-class quiz where we had to convert a char to an int
 by subtracting the value of ‘0’.
